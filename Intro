## An introduction to ISO 27001: 2022
Before jumping into the ISO 27001 standard, let’s understand some terms. 

### Information security
It is a concept that refers to the presentation of 3 properties of information which are CIA
- **Confidentiality**: Information not being available, or not being disclosed, to unauthorized individuals or entities.
- **Integrity**: Accuracy and completeness of information, or preventing information from being corrupted.
- **Availability**: Making the information accessible and usable on demand by an authorized person or entity.

### Information Security Management
The coordinated activities to achieve, maintain and improve information security, by identifying security risks and applying suitable controls to address them.

### Information Security Management System (ISMS)
An ISMS is a systematic approach that the company may decide to use when it comes to information security.
- ISO/IEC 27001 and the ISO/IEC 27000 standards in the family offer a framework for establishing and applying such an information security management system.
- This standard provide a model for how an organization can design and implement such a system, such as ISMS.

### Principles for the successful implementation of an ISMS
- Awareness of the need for information security.
- Assign responsibility for information security.
- Incorporate management commitment and interests of the stakeholders.
- Determine the appropriate controls for Risk assessment.
- Incorporate security as an essential element of information networks and systems.
- Active prevention and detection of security incidents.
- Comprehensive approach to information security management.
- Continued reassessment of information security and make modifications.
These are taken from ISO/IEC 27000 standard
