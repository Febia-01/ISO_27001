There are 93 security controls that an organization must apply, must implement, as part of its ISMS.

## Organizational controls

All the controls that have to be applied at an organization level come under this category. There are 37 controls under this category.

### A 5.1 Policies for Information Security

- Define, approve by management, publish, communicate, and acknowledge by relevant personnel and interested parties on information security policy and topic-specific policies. The policies must be reviewed at planned intervals and in case of significant changes.
- A high-level information security policy supported by topic-specific policies on different subjects (e.g., incident management, access control, backup, asset management, etc.)

### A 5.2 Information security roles and responsibilities

- Define and allocate roles and responsibilities for information security, according to the needs of the organization.
- Communicate roles and responsibilities for information security and ensure they are understood

The standard is not very prescriptive here. It offers freedom to the organization to decide which are the roles and responsibilities that it considers necessary. But it’s important to make sure that employees are aware of their tasks and responsibilities. 

### A 5.3 Segregation of duties

- Segregate conflicting duties and areas of responsibility.
- Avoid the situation where a single person has full control.
- Consider key transactions, relationships, or activities.

It’s up to the organization to determine where segregation is necessary and how this principle will be applied.

### A 5.4 Management Responsibilities

- All personnel shall be required by management to apply information security according to the policies and procedures of the organization.
- Top management plays a key role in information security.

The management should ensure that a whistle-blowing system exists so that violations of information security rules can be reported.

### A 5.5 Contact with Authorities

- Establish and maintain contact with relevant authorities.
- To prepare for upcoming legal changes, to improve legal and regulatory compliance, and to be used in case of security incidents.

Maintaining contact with the authorities is both preventive and corrective control. To implement this control the management should appoint one or more individuals to have the responsibility of maintaining the contact.

### A 5.6 Contact with Special Interest Groups

- Establish and maintain contacts with special interest groups, security forums, or professional associations.
- To stay informed about threats or security best practices and to get support when dealing with a security incident.

Maintaining contact with the special interest groups is both preventive and corrective control. To implement this control the management should appoint one or more individuals to have the responsibility of maintaining the contact.

### A 5.7 Threat intelligence

- Collect and analyze information relating to information security threats to produce threat intelligence.
- Produce threat intelligence or rely on external parties (consultants, governmental agencies, etc.). Share threat intelligence with others.

An organization can produce threat intelligence on its own. But this is difficult and quite rare because it requires resources. So, it’s usually something that only a few and mostly large organizations can do. The option for most companies is to obtain threat intelligence. 

### A 5.8 Information security in project management

- Integrate information security into project management.
- Threat information security is an integral part of any kind of project undertaken by the organization.

The idea is that projects differ from regular activities, they are sometimes unique, and have limited time available for completion, because they may follow procedures and rules that differ from the ones commonly used in the organization.

### A 5.9 Inventory of information and other associated assets

- Develop and maintain an inventory of information and other associated assets, including owners.
- Assets shall be included in one or several inventories and owned.

### A 5.10 Acceptable use of information and other associated assets

- Identify, document, and implement rules for the acceptable use and procedures for handling information and other associated assets.
- Consider a topic-specific policy on the acceptable use of information and other associated assets.

### A 5.11 Return of assets

- Ensure personnel and other interested parties return the assets in their possession and belonging to the organization when their employment, contract, or agreement is terminated or changed.
- Prevent confidential information from being left on devices and restrict access to data for those ending or changing their relationship with the organization.

### A 5.12 Classification of information

- Classify information following the information security needs of the organization, based on confidentiality, integrity, availability, and the relevant requirements of interested parties.
- Consider a topic-specific policy on information classification, this is a recommendation by ISO/IEC 27002 standard.
- Adopt a classification scheme (e.g., Confidential, Restricted, Internal use, Public)

ISO 27001 does not have any requirements as to what exactly this scheme should look like. So, it is the choice of each organization.

### A 5.13 Labelling of information

- Develop and implement an appropriate set of procedures for information labeling, under the classification scheme adopted.
- Labelling ensures that persons in the organization are aware of the classification of the information they use.

To reduce workload, in certain circumstances like the case of public documents, labels can be omitted. And this is something that should be specified in the labeling procedure. 

### A 5.14 Information transfer

- Ensure that rules, procedures, or agreements are in place for the transfer of information within the organization and between the organization and other parties, for all types of transfer facilities.
- Apply controls in line with the classification of the information transferred.
- Consider the transfer of information on electronic and paper support, as well as the verbal transfer of information.

ISO/IEC 27002 provides some guidelines for electronic transfers, and transfer of information on physical support including paper and verbal transfer of information.

### A 5.15 Access control

- Rules to control the physical and logical access to information and other associated assets shall be established and implemented based on business and information security requirements.
- Consider a topic-specific policy on access control to define principles, generic provisions, rules, or responsibilities.

As a preventive control, it is intended to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by ensuring that only authorized access to it is allowed and unauthorized access is prevented.

**MAC → Mandatory access control**: MAC restricts access based on security policies defined by the system administrator.

For example, in government environments, different security clearances (like Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential) dictate access to classified information.

**DAC → Discretionary access control:** DAC allows owners of resources to determine who can access those resources. 

For instance, a file system where users can set permissions (read, write, execute) on their files is a classic example of DAC.

**RBAC → Role-based access control**: RBAC assigns permissions to roles rather than individuals. Users inherit permissions based on their assigned roles, simplifying access management. 

In a university system, roles like student, professor, and administrator might have predefined access levels to academic records and administrative tools.

**ABAC → Attribute-based access control**: ABAC uses attributes of users, systems, and resources to define access policies.

For example, access to a document might be based on attributes like the user's department, the document's sensitivity level, and the time of day.

The principle is that every company is free to choose the appropriate options, considering its specifics, its resources, and other factors.

The principles for spending different access control functions like access request and access authorization should be documented.

### 5.16 Identity management

- The full life cycle of identities shall be managed
- Identity management should allow for the unique identification of persons and systems accessing information assets, and it should enable the appropriate assignment of access rights.

**Identity management guidelines from ISO 27002.**

→ One identity should be linked to one single person. [If there is a need to assign the same ID to several persons, then this is possible but it has to be justified.]

→ Identities no longer required must be disabled.

→ Logging and monitoring can be effective with this.

### 5.17 Authentication information

- Control the allocation and management of authentication information with a management process, including advising personnel on the appropriate handling of authentication information.
- Consider the allocation of authentication information, the responsibilities of users, and a password management system.

The idea is to grant access to information and associated assets, a user shall go through an authentication process.

In ISO/IEC 27002, we have guidelines for the allocation of authentication information, for the responsibilities of users about the management of this information, as well as for password management.

### 5.18 Access rights

- Provide, review, modify, and remove access rights to information and other associated assets by the topic-specific policy and rules on access control.
- Ensure that only authorized users have access to information and associated assets.
- Separate the approval of access rights from their implementation.
- Review access rights periodically and make necessary adjustments.

**Access rights guidelines in ISO 27002.**

→ The provisioning of access rights to an asset should only be done after obtaining proper authorization from the owner of that asset and/or from the management if necessary.

→ There should be a separation between the approval of access rights and their actual implementation.

→ The activation of access rights must come after the successful completion of the authorization process and not before.

→ The access rights of those who leave the company or change positions should be removed.

→ There should be a central record of access rights granted  to a user ID.

and so on.

### 5.19 Information security in supplier relationships

- Define and implement processes and procedures to manage the information security risks that are associated with the use of products and services obtained from suppliers.
- Consider a topic-specific policy to describe principles, requirements, and basic security controls that suppliers are expected to apply.
### 5.20 Addressing information security within supplier agreements

- Establish and agree with each supplier relevant information security requirements based on the type of supplier relationship.
- Include information security requirements in the contracts or agreements.

Let's see **some of the recommendations in ISO/IEC 27002.**

→ Include or reference a description of the information classification scheme to ensure both parties use the same system, or provide a mapping if different schemes are used.

→ Detail the obligations of both parties regarding the implementation of security controls.

→ Include any legal, statutory, or regulatory requirements, such as privacy legislation, and how both parties intend to comply.

→ Define the process and conditions for authorizing supplier access to information, including identifying persons authorized to access the company's information and associated assets.

→ Specify screening requirements for suppliers' personnel with access to sensitive information.

→ Designate contact persons for information security matters.

→ Outline possible consequences if the supplier fails to meet the company's security requirements.

→ Describe how incidents are to be managed.

→ Clarify if the supplier is allowed to subcontract work and, if so, outline the conditions and security requirements that apply.

→ Refer to business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements in the contract, including backup requirements such as frequency, type, location, and safe transfer of information between parties.

→ Define obligations for the supplier to provide periodic reports on the effectiveness of its security controls.

→ Include arrangements for the termination of the contract, specifying requirements for the return of assets, ongoing confidentiality, and transfer of information created during the contract to the organization or another supplier.

### 5.21 Managing information security in the information and communication technology (ICT) supply chain

- Define and implement processes and procedures to manage the information security risks associated with the ICT products and services supply chain.
- Require suppliers to propagate appropriate security practices throughout the supply chain.
- Work with suppliers to solve issues and share information about products and services.

Establishing and communicating information security requirements to suppliers and ensuring that they comply is not enough. The company shall also consider and address the risks of the supply chain of information and communication technology, products, and services. That’s the idea behind this control.

Not easy to apply this control, especially in the case of small or medium-sized organizations.

Considering the complicated supply chains of today, it's difficult to know where products like hardware or software that can have a significant impact on information security originate. So, what can be done?

Well, **according to ISO/IEC 27002,**

→ Require suppliers to propagate appropriate security practices throughout the supply chain if they subcontract services or buy hardware components incorporated into products sold to the organization.

→ Identify critical components purchased for operations and ensure an adequate level of information security.

→ Trace critical products throughout the supply chain and identify their origin.

→ Collaborate with suppliers and share information about the ICT supply chain and any issues that may arise.

→ Require ICT product suppliers to provide information about the software components used in their products.

→ While clear traceability for all products and components may not be possible, verify and confirm through testing, credible certifications, and other methods that security requirements are met and that products are genuine and unaltered from their specifications.

### 5.22 Monitoring, review, and change management of supplier services

- Regularly monitor, review, evaluate, and manage changes in supplier information security practices and service delivery.
- Ensure that services maintain an agreed level and changes to services do not come with a negative impact on information security.

**According to ISO/IEC 27002**,

→ Monitor the performance levels for the services received from suppliers to confirm that what has been agreed is delivered.

→ Assign an individual or a team to be responsible for monitoring that the provisions in the service agreements are met.

→ Obtain reports from suppliers on service levels.

→ Hold regular meetings with suppliers to discuss the provision of services and assess progress.

→Conduct audits of suppliers and sub-suppliers, and review independent audit reports relevant to the way suppliers manage information security.

→ Monitor any changes to supplier services, such as enhancements, new technologies, new applications or systems, updated policies, new information security controls, new sub-suppliers, and new locations, for any potential negative impact on information security.

→ Ensure suppliers have adequate business continuity and disaster recovery arrangements to continue providing services at an adequate level in case of a major failure or disaster.

→ Investigate any operational problems, events, or disruptions in the provision of services, and review audit trails or records.

### A 5.23 Information security for use of cloud services

- Establish processes for the acquisition, use, management, and exit from cloud services by the information security requirements of the organization.
- Consider a topic-specific policy for principles and generic requirements on the use of cloud services.
- As necessary, do a risk assessment and implement controls to address the security risks of the use of cloud services.

In the previous edition of ISO 27001, we did not have a control dedicated to cloud services.

ISO/IEC 27002 recommends the company do a risk assessment and then implement controls that it considers to be appropriate to mitigate the risks of the use of cloud services.

### A 5.24 Information security incident management planning and preparation

- Plan and prepare for managing information security incidents by defining, establishing, and communicating information security incident management processes, roles, and responsibilities.
- Event != incident

An information security event is a situation that indicates a possible breach of the information security policy, or a failure of controls.

An information security incident refers to one or more unwanted or unexpected events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and that threaten information security.

ISO/IEC 27002, recommends the methods for reporting information security events and processes for managing information security incidents.

ISO/IEC 27035 → Information security incident management.

### A 5.25 Assessment and decision on information security events

- Assess information security events and decide if they will be categorized as incidents.
- Triage of events to determine which events represent information security incidents.

### A 5.26 Response to information security incidents

- Respond to information security incidents following documented procedures.

### A 5.27 Learning from Information Security Incidents

- Use the knowledge gained from information security incidents to strengthen and improve the information security controls.
- The lessons learned while dealing with security incidents can prove useful for preventing future incidents and for improving the response of the organization.

### A 5.28 Collection of evidence

- Establish and implement procedures for the identification, collection, acquisition, and preservation of evidence related to information security events.
- Collected evidence may help the organization in case of a contractual dispute or investigation.
- Consider the competence of those involved in the collection and protection of evidence.

ISO/IEC 27037 → Guidelines for identification, collection, acquisition, and prevention of digital evidence. 

An important mention is for the company to be aware of the relevant legislation on this subject, which means, the information should be accepted in the court or by authorities.

### A 5.29 Information security during disruption

- Plan how to maintain information security at an appropriate level during disruption.
- Prepare to maintain an adequate level of information security in case of a major incident.

The business continuity strategies and plans of the organization should include provisions for how information security will continue to operate in case of a major incident.

Business continuity is of course a discipline of its own and ISO has addressed it in a series of standards for those organizations that want to implement a business continuity management system.

ISO 22301 & ISO 22302 are popular standards for this discipline.

### A 5.30 ICT readiness for business continuity

- Plan, implement, maintain, and test ICT readiness based on the business continuity objectives and ICT continuity requirements.
- Key activities rely on ICT (information and communication technology)
- Understand ICT readiness requirements and address the risks of prioritized activities being disrupted.

### A 5.31 Legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements

- Identify, document, and keep up to date the legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements relevant to information security along with the organization's approach to meet them.
- Assign responsibilities for identifying and keeping up-to-date legal, statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements that refer to information security.

ISO 27001 does not explicitly require here legal compliance audits, but this is an option for the organization to confirm that legal and other requirements are met and to identify potential instances of non-compliance.

### A 5.32 Intellectual property rights

- Implement appropriate procedures to protect intellectual property rights.
- Consider a topic-specific policy to outline the commitment to the protection of intellectual property rights.

The purpose of this control is to protect the company from the negative consequences, like fines, or bad publicity that may result from ignoring intellectual property rights.

### A 5.33 Protection of records

- Protect records from loss, destruction, falsification, unauthorized access, and unauthorized release.
- Establish a retention schedule for the records generated.
- Implement rules for the storage, handling, or disposal of records.

### A 5.34 Privacy and protection of personally identifiable information (PII)

- Identify and meet the requirements regarding the preservation of privacy and protection of PII according to applicable laws, regulations, and contractual requirements.
- Identify the applicable legislation, regulations, and contractual requirements and ensure compliance.

We don’t have a requirement in ISO/IEC 27001 for the appointment of a DPO (Data Protection Officer) or a similar role unless the legislation requires so. This approach is recommended in ISO/IEC 27002 to make sure that privacy responsibilities are assigned and communicated. 

### A 5.35 Independent review of information security

- Review independently at planned intervals and whenever significant changes occur, the approach to managing information security and its implementation, including people, processes, and technology
- The reviews should be conducted by competent persons who are independent of the activities reviewed.

Independent reviews include internal audits & external audits.

### A 5.36 Compliance with policies, rules, and standards for information security

- Review regularly compliance with the organization's information security policy, topic-specific policies, rules, and standards.
- The reviews should be conducted by managers, product, service, or information owners. Consider inspections, observation, or the use of automated tools.

### A 5.37 Documented operating procedures

- Document and make available to the personnel who need operating procedures for information processing facilities.
- Consider documenting procedures for activities to be performed by many employees in the same way, for activities performed rarely, when activities are transferred to new personnel, or for new activities.

ISO/IEC 27002 offers some recommendations for documenting operating procedures:

- The company should have procedures for activities that are intended to be performed in the same way by many employees.
- It’s a good idea to have procedures for the activities that are performed rarely.
- When activities are transferred to a new personnel it’s recommended to document procedures to explain how those activities are to be carried out.
etc.

## People Controls

There are 8 controls under this category. 

### A 6.1 Screening

- Carry out background checks on all candidates to become personnel before joining the organization and on an ongoing basis, considering the applicable laws, regulations, and ethics. The checks must be proportional to the business requirements, the perceived risks, and the classification of information to be accessed.
- To prevent hiring the wrong person and to ensure personnel remain suitable for the job.
- The screening applies to all who work in the company (employees, consultants, freelancers, temporary staff, etc.)

The purpose of Screening control is quite obvious, to prevent the organization from hiring the wrong person and it should also confirm that the individual remains suitable for the job.

**What aspects should be included in the screening?**

In ISO/IEC 27002, screening is an essential component of an organization’s security framework. The process typically includes verifying a candidate’s identity using multiple documents, independently confirming academic and professional qualifications (preferably by direct contact with educational institutions), closely examining the candidate’s resume, and reviewing professional references. Depending on the organization's requirements, additional checks may be necessary, such as criminal record reviews or credit history checks. The depth and scope of these background checks are determined by the organization’s business needs, the classification level of the information the individual will access, and the security risks related to the role and responsibilities of the candidate.

In some cases, organizations may deem it necessary to conduct further assessments, such as drug tests, polygraph exams, or other specific evaluations, to mitigate potential risks. It's critical to note that screening involves the handling of personally identifiable information (PII). Consequently, organizations must comply with relevant privacy legislation and obtain the candidate’s explicit consent for the screening process. Additionally, clear guidelines should be in place regarding the retention and disposal of personal data collected during screening, particularly for candidates who are not selected for employment.

Organizations are advised to formalize their screening procedures in a documented process, outlining responsibilities for conducting verifications, detailing the methodology for screenings, and specifying any limitations. This procedure should also include provisions for ongoing screenings, not just at the time of initial employment. Periodic re-screenings should be conducted based on the conditions established by the organization, particularly when an individual transitions to a new position involving different security risks or access to more sensitive information. In such cases, screening should be reevaluated in light of the new circumstances to ensure continuous security compliance.

### A 6.2 Terms and conditions of employment

- It requires to state in the employment contractual agreements the personnel's and the organization's responsibilities for information security
- Consider for inclusion in contracts the rules for access control, return of assets, protection of information following its classification level, the transfer of information, the relationship with suppliers, non-disclosure requirements, or a mention of the disciplinary process.

**What information security responsibilities should be part of the contract?**

ISO/IEC 27002 provides important recommendations for integrating information security into the employment lifecycle. One key aspect is ensuring that employees adhere to the organization's policies on access control, asset use, asset return, and information protection. These policies must be aligned with the classification of information and the organization's security protocols for data transfer and supplier relationships.

Employment contracts should incorporate specific requirements for non-disclosure, particularly for employees who will have access to confidential or sensitive information. In addition, the disciplinary process— which may be discussed in further detail within organizational policy— can be referenced in these contracts. This includes confidentiality obligations that remain enforceable even after the employee departs from the organization.

These are just a few examples of the information security clauses that can be included in employment contracts. Alternatively, organizations may opt for a different approach, such as creating a comprehensive document like a Code of Conduct. This document can outline all relevant information security requirements, and adherence to it can be mandated in the employment contract. By doing so, organizations can link security obligations to contractual agreements without embedding every requirement directly into the contract, ensuring flexibility and clarity while maintaining security standards.

### A 6.3 Information security awareness, education, and training

- Ensure that personnel and relevant interested parties receive appropriate information security awareness, education and training, and regular updates of the organization's information security policy, topic-specific policies, and procedures, as relevant for their job functions.
- Awareness refers to all who work for the organization, and it should focus also on "why" and not only on "what".
- The education and training refer mainly to the technical personnel who need specific knowledge and skills.

The purpose of Information security awareness, education, and training is to ensure an adequate level of competence and information security awareness for the persons who work for the company.

ISO/IEC 27002 emphasizes that awareness efforts should not only explain what actions need to be taken but also clarify the underlying reasons behind them. Employees should understand both the requirements and the purpose of these measures, as well as the potential impact their actions and behaviors can have on information security. Awareness programs typically cover fundamental security practices such as incident reporting, basic controls like malware protection and strong password selection, and the principle that each individual is accountable for their actions. Additionally, these efforts highlight the organization's commitment, especially from top management, to continuously improve information security.

In addition to awareness, ISO/IEC 27002 also stresses the importance of education and training for technical personnel. These individuals need specialized skills and knowledge to maintain the security of devices, services, and applications. Organizations must ensure that these skills are readily available, whether through internal training programs, providing access to external courses, allocating time and resources for self-study, or encouraging participation in industry-specific groups or forums. If necessary, the organization should also be prepared to hire or contract experts from outside to ensure that the required level of technical competence is achieved and maintained.

### A 6.4 Disciplinary process

- Establish and communicate a disciplinary process to take action against personnel and other interested parties who have committed an information security policy violation.
- Everyone in the organization should be aware of the disciplinary process.
- It may also include rewards for those who demonstrate excellent information security behavior.

This may be seen as a sensitive matter because it involves punishments, but it may also include rewards for those who demonstrate excellent information security behaviors.

### A 6.5 Responsibilities after termination or change of employment

- Define, enforce, and communicate to relevant personnel and interested parties the information security responsibilities and duties that remain valid after termination or change of employment.
- Determine if there are confidentiality requirements that extend beyond the period of employment.
- Apply a similar process for the change of employment.

### A 6.6 Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements

- Personnel and other interested parties shall sign confidentiality or non - disclosure agreements that reflect the organization's needs for protecting information.
- Consider that there may be different confidentiality requirements for the different positions in the organization.

ISO/IEC 27002 offers several recommendations for what should be included in a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement (NDA). These agreements should clearly define the information that requires protection, such as data labeled as confidential, restricted, or for internal use. The agreement must outline measures to prevent unauthorized access to this information and specify the actions that should be taken in the event of an information leak, whether suspected or confirmed.

The NDA should also detail the potential consequences for employees who violate the terms of the agreement. Furthermore, it should cover any obligations that remain in effect after employment ends, such as ongoing confidentiality commitments, as previously discussed. The agreement may also include conditions for the return of confidential information to the organization, or requirements for securely destroying the information when the agreement is terminated.

These elements, as recommended by ISO/IEC 27002, form the foundation of a robust confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement. Organizations may tailor these agreements further, incorporating additional provisions as needed, provided they align with applicable laws and regulations.

### A 6.7 Remote Working

Remote working is not only about working from home but about working from any location that is not under the organization’s control.

- Implement security measures when personnel are working remotely to protect the information accessed, processed, or stored outside the organization's premises.
- Consider a topic-specific policy for remote working, supported by procedures to detail how the security risks associated with working remotely are to be managed.

ISO/IEC 27002 recommends the establishment of a topic-specific policy on remote working, which should address key aspects related to security and operations. This policy should define the types of work that can be performed remotely, as well as the types of information that may be accessed or processed from remote locations. It should also clarify who has the authority to approve remote work arrangements and outline the physical security requirements for remote working environments.

Other critical considerations include communication requirements for accessing the organization’s systems and applications, and whether the company will provide the necessary equipment or allow the use of personal devices for work purposes. These general provisions set the foundation for secure and controlled remote work.

In addition to the policy, a detailed procedure should be implemented to manage the risks associated with remote work. These risks include unauthorized access to equipment and information, as well as the potential for communication channels between the company and the remote working site to be compromised. The procedure should address secure communication protocols, including requirements for two-factor authentication, backup processes, and device tracking. It should also ensure the organization can remotely wipe data from devices used at remote sites if necessary.

Further, the procedure should cover the revocation of access rights for remote workers when needed, and establish requirements for firewalls, malware protection, and restrictions on the use of public networks. By addressing these areas, organizations can create a robust framework that mitigates the security risks associated with remote work while ensuring operational efficiency and data protection.

### A 6.8 Information security event reporting

The idea of this control is to ensure that the company has an adequate solution for reporting information security events. It can be an online platform. It can be through the use of emails or instant messages.

- Provide a mechanism for personnel to report observed or suspected information security events promptly, through appropriate channels.
- Establish an accessible and easy-to-understand system for personnel to report information security events.

ISO/IEC 27002 provides several examples of what should be considered a security event that must be reported, whether observed or suspected. These include instances where a security control is not functioning properly or as intended, human errors, unauthorized access, uncontrolled changes to systems or applications, and malfunctions of hardware or software.

Such events, when identified, must be reported immediately through the organization’s approved reporting channels. The prompt reporting of information security events is critical because even a few minutes can have a significant impact on the potential consequences of a security incident. Timely reporting allows the organization to respond swiftly and effectively, minimizing damage and addressing vulnerabilities before they escalate.

The emphasis on quick and accurate reporting underlines the importance of having clear communication processes in place to ensure that all security events are properly handled and mitigated promptly.
