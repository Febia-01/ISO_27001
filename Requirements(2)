# Management System Requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 [part 2]
Here is the next requirement.
## Clause 6: Planning
The planning for every thing that has to be implemented will take place under this chapter. There are three sub-clauses for this. Let’s check it in detail.

### 6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities
Determine risks and opportunities and plan actions to address them.
First, let’s understand what is risk?
Risk is the potential for an event or action to cause harm or loss to an organization. This is a threat exploiting a vulnerability which results a significant impact on the organization.
Risks are of two types. i.e, Risks in relation to the ISMS and risks in relation with information security (loss of CIA).
1. Risks related to ISMS.
    For e.g,  
    - Unclear processes and responsibilities for information security management.
    - Poor engagement of the top management.
    - Poor awareness of employees about the information security system and its purpose.
    - Insufficient documentation for the ISMS.
    ISO/IEC 27001 does not say that the organization shall access the risks in this category. Determine them and plan actions to address them.
    ISO/IEC 27003 says that the company can very well consider the word “determine” to be equivalent to “assess”.
2. Risks related to information security
    Any threat that can exploit a vulnerability and cause for the loss of CIA.
    For e.g,, Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, DoS attack, Phishing attack, etc.

**6.1.1 General**
We could say that an ISMS is mostly about managing information security risks.
- An ISMS should serves as a preventive tool.
- Proper risk management is the key for an effective information security system.
Risk management includes risk assessment and risk treatment. 
ISO/IEC 27005 standard dedicated to information security risk management offers guidelines for risk identification, for risk analysis, risk evaluation or treatment, and other aspects as well.

**6.1.2 Information security risk assessment**
Define and apply a process for the information security risk assessment.
**Risk**: the effect of uncertainty on objectives. 
**Information security risks**: associated with the potential that threats will exploit the vulnerabilities of an information asset and cause harm to an organization.
RISK = Consequences x Likelihood
- Criteria for performing information security risk assessments refer to consequences, likelihood and level of risk.
- The combination of consequences and likelihood will give us a level of risk.
Repeated information security risk assessments should produce consistent, valid and comparable results.
Risk identification approaches: event-based and asset-based.
**Risk owners**: Identify risk owners (persons of entities with the accountability and authority to manage risks.).
**Risk analysis:** Assets possible consequences and realistic likelihood for the risks identified to determine the level of risk.
**Risk evaluation**: Compare the results of the risk analysis with the acceptance criteria.
Risk assessment method used by the company should fulfill three conditions:
1. If different persons assess the same risks in the same context, then the result will be similar.
2. It should be possible to compare the results of repeated assessments.
3. The assessment of information security risks procedures results that record as much as possible to reality.
Step 1: Identify the risk and risk owner
Step 2: Analyze the risk
Step 3: Evaluate the risk
The standard requires that the organization retains documented information about its risk assessment.

**6.1.3 Information security risk treatment**
Risk treatment process
- select appropriate treatment options
- determine the appropriate controls
- formulate a risk treatment plan
- obtain the approval of risk owners for the plan, and acceptance for residual risks.
Risk treatment methods
1. Risk Avoidance
2. Risk Mitigation
3. Risk Acceptance
4. Risk Transfer
This will be implemented through
1. Preventive [Eg, information classification]
2. Detective [Eg, Logging]
3. Corrective [Eg, information backup]
**Statement of Applicability (SoA)**
This is the map of the ISMS implementation.
It contains:
- necessary controls (including justification for inclusion and implementation status)
- justification for the controls excluded
It is possible that some of the controls in Annex A cannot be applied because of the characteristics of the company.
ISO/IEC 27001 says that the organization shall produce a statement of applicability where it should include the information security controls that are considered necessary, justification for why they are needed, in other words, why they have been included, the status of their implementation, because a control can be fully implemented, it can be partially implemented or not implemented. And one more thing, the statement of applicability should include justification for why any control from Annex A has been excluded by the organization. So, we need justification for why controls have been included in the statement of applicability and there can be a single generic justification for all.
Another document to be produced by organization according to ISO/IEC 27001 is Risk treatment plan. The purpose of the risk treatment plan is to document for each risk what treatment option or options proposed for treating each risk and their status. And information about who is responsible and accountable for the treatment of each risk.
Retain documented information about the risk treatment process.
For each information security risk:
- treatment options
- actions to treat the risk
- status of implementation
- responsibilities, resources, timeframes
**Residual risk:** the risk that remains after treatment (accepted by the risk owner).

### 6.2 Information security objectives and planning to achieve them
Establish information security objectives at relevant functions and levels.
- Set security objectives.
- Plan to achieve the objectives.
Requirements proposed by ISO/IEC 27001:
- Consistent with the policy
- Measurable (if practicable)
- Take into consideration applicable requirements
- Monitored, communicated and updated (as appropriate)
Plan for the achievement of information security objectives.
> What will be done?
> What resources are necessary?
> Who will be responsible?
> When each objectives will be completed?
> How the results will be evaluated?
For example, if an organization sets an objective to implement a new DLP (Data Loss Prevention solution) in the next year, then it should specify what exactly will be done, define criteria, compare offers, contact vendors, test the product, etc. Who is responsible to coordinate the process, what resources will be committed to this project or what will be the timelines and milestones for the activities involved.
ISO/IEC 27001 wants documented information to be available on the information security objectives and on the plans for their achievement.
In case of an audit for the ISMS, most certainly the auditor will ask about documented information as evidence of establishing and following.

### 6.3 Planning of changes
Changes to the ISMS shall be carried out in a planned manner, to avoid unwanted consequences.
Any change that may impact ISMS like,
- Changes to personnel,
- Changes to processes.
- Changes to information security.
A good idea for the company would be to develop a roadmap for the implementation of the change.
Best practice says to test the change on a sample, like an organizational unit or a limited number of users, before its application in the entire company.
